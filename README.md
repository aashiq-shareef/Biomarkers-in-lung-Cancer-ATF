# Biomarkers-in-lung-Cancer-ATF

## Introduction
In this project, the field of bioinformatics is utilized to process and analyze large-scale biological data, specifically focusing on genomic data, using computational techniques and tools. The aim is to identify potential gene targets in lung cancer, addressing the urgent need to improve prognosis and treatment outcomes for this disease.

## Project Description
Lung cancer, particularly affecting males, has become one of the top 5 cancer types worldwide. Unfortunately, for patients diagnosed with stage 3 and stage 4 lung cancer, there is currently no cure available. The primary objective is to extend the lifespan of patients, typically up to a maximum of 5 years post-detection. However, existing methods primarily focus on prolonging lifespan rather than targeting specific genes responsible for inhibiting the spread of lung cancer. This project aims to fill this gap by identifying potential gene targets in lung cancer.

## Proposed Solution & Justification
The proposed solution involves utilizing bioinformatics analysis to screen common biomarkers and drug targets across various pathological types of lung cancer. By employing different data sources and statistical methods, we aim to achieve diverse results. Additionally, a robust pipeline will be constructed to facilitate the integration of this analysis into a Python package, ensuring accessibility and usability for researchers and clinicians.
